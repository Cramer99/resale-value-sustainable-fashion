## 🧮 Project Overview

| Item                  | Description |
|----------------------|-------------|
| **Dataset**          | `resale_fashion_data.csv` – ~30 resale listings (brand, item type, original vs sold price, condition, etc.) |
| **Cleaning & Analysis** | `1_clean_analysis.ipynb` – Normalizes price fields, categorizes brands, computes resale retention rates |
| **Visualization**    | `resale_trends.twbx` or `charts.xlsx` – Brand-level resale retention graphs and comparisons |
| **Report & Insights** | READMEs and visuals in this repo summarize findings and showcase your storytelling |

---

## 🔍 Key Insights

- Sustainable brands maintain ~35% higher resale price on average than fast-fashion labels  
- The retention rate varies by item type: jackets and jeans hold value better than tops and accessories  
- Example: Eileen Fisher jackets retained ~60% of their original price after six months on average

## 🧭 Next Steps

- Expand dataset to 100+ entries and include sale duration and condition weighting  
- Automate data collection via web scraping 
- Sharpen visual narratives using interactive dashboards (e.g., Tableau Story features)
